## Features

- Interactive cardiovascular risk assessment
- Personalized health recommendations
- User-friendly interface designed for teenage women
- Evidence-based scoring system
- Educational resources about cardiovascular health

## Technical Architecture

The application is built using:
- HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling
- P5.js library for animated elements
- SurveyJS for survey implementation and data collection
- Modern responsive design principles
- Evidence-based algorithms for risk assessment
- Secure data handling practices

## Scientific Background

The Healthy Heart Score (HHS) is a validated online assessment tool that estimates cardiovascular disease risk based on self-reported modifiable health behaviors. It was developed using data from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, with validation in young adults through the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort study. The tool is particularly suitable for younger women as it:

- Requires no clinical measurements or laboratory assessments
- Focuses on modifiable health behaviors
- Performs optimally in individuals without established CVD risk factors
